								<h1>About <span>E-Banking System</span></h1>
								<h3>Online banking systems</h3>
								<p class="about-paddingB">The concept of online banking as we know it today dates back to the
                                        early 1980s, when it was first envisioned and experimented with. However, it
                                        was only in 1995 (on October 6, to be exact) that Presidential Savings Bank
                                        first announced the facility for regular client use. The idea was quickly
                                        snapped up by other banks like Wells Fargo, Chase Manhattan and Security
                                        First Network Bank. Today, quite a few banks operate solely via the Internet
                                        and have no  ̳four-walls‘ entity at all.
                                        In the beginning, its inventors had predicted that it would be only a
                                        matter of time before online banking completely replaced the conventional
                                        kind. Facts now prove that this was an overoptimistic assessment - many
                                        customers still harbor an inherent distrust in the process. Others have opted
                                        not to use many of the offered facilities because of bitter experience with
                                        online frauds, and inability to use online banking services.
                                        Be that as it may, it is estimated that a total of 55 million families in
                                        America will be active users of online banking by the year 2010. Despite the
                                        fact that many American banks still do not offer this facility to customers, this
                                        may turn out to be an accurate prediction. The number of online banking
                                        customers has been increasing at an exponential rate.
                                        Initially, the main attraction is the elimination of tiresome bureaucratic
                                        red tape in registering for an account, and the endless paperwork involved in it.</p>
